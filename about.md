My name is Sukie Baphomet Shepherd, and I make things.

It started innocently, of course -- a drawing here, a bit of code there. Constructive hands are the Devil's playthings, however, and before long I was hooked. Dark influences had bamboozled me, and I began having ambitions of *publishing*. Being creative is one thing, sure -- everyone has their private shame -- but to do it in front of others for their lurid entertainment? It's a wonder I haven't been disowned.

So I implore you, dear patron: turn away now from this shameful display, this sinful carnival of self-indulgence, before you too become ensnared by the temptations of *innovation* and *personal expression*. It'll be your ruin, as it was mine.
